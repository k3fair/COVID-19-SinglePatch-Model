Simulation and visualization code for manuscript by Fair, Karatayev, Anand, and Bauch (2021). To run a set of simulations or generate a figure, make all required option selections (detailed within each script) and launch script.

All data needed to run visualization script are included in the "InputFiles" folder. Expected runtime varies between scripts, but an individual simulation should run within 1 minute.

**Scripts**

* sim code runs runs simulations for experiment varying a single parameter at a time, outputs results of these simulations. 

* vis code visualizes results of [add name of sim code]

* Script that runs the single sim? and associated visualization?


**Input Files**

* list off the files for the different experiments


**System & hardware requirements**

 * Windows 10 Pro Version 2004

 * Sufficient RAM to support storage of data structures during simulations

**Installation guides**

All software should install within a few minutes on a standard computer, the versions listed here are those the scripts have been tested on.

 * R Version 4.0.3 https://www.r-project.org/

 * R Studio Version 1.2.5019 (IDE for R) https://rstudio.com/
