# COVID-19-SinglePatch-model

**Note:** This repository is currently under construction


Simulation and visualization code for manuscript by Fair, Karatayev, Anand, and Bauch (2021). Model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission used to explore how physical factors and human behavior impact the persistence of infectious diseases.

To run a set of simulations or generate a figure, make all required option selections (detailed within each script) and launch the appropriate script.

All data needed to run visualization script are included in the "InputFiles" folder, except for inputs to COVIDviz_singlepatch_birthdeathexp.R, due to file size restrictions. These can, however, be generated using covidHier0.35Lite_singlepatch_birthdeathexp.R.

All code has a GNU GPLv3 license (see CODE_LICENSE for details), and all data has a CC-BY-4.0 license (see DATA_LICENSE for details).

**Scripts**

* sim code runs runs simulations for experiment varying a single parameter at a time, outputs results of these simulations. 

* vis code visualizes results of [add name of sim code]

* Script that runs the single sim? and associated visualization?


**Input Files**

* list off the files for the different experiments


**System & hardware requirements**

 * Windows 10 Pro Version 2004

 * Sufficient RAM to support storage of data structures during simulations

**Installation guides**

All software should install within a few minutes on a standard computer, the versions listed here are those the scripts have been tested on.

 * R Version 4.0.3 https://www.r-project.org/

 * R Studio Version 1.2.5019 (IDE for R) https://rstudio.com/
